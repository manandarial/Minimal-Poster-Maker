# Minimal-Poster-Maker
Inspired by a reddit post on r/minimalst_art I created a website to display your image in a minimalistic view. You can modify all the details from the left side and see all the changes render on the right. Sadly this is just the frontend part which means you can only view the changes but you won't be able to download it. For that backend programming is required and I'm still learning frontend. So in the future I'll make the backend that'll allow you to download the poster as an image.
